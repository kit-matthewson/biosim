## Abstract
The topic of Evolution is a difficult one to grasp, especially at its most complex when taught for A-Level. The subject requires knowledge of many interacting biological systems and processes along with their underlying causes. I believe that the current teaching method, consisting of presentations and written work, is suitable for considerable improvement through a computer simulation. A visual demonstration of the topic in action, with the user able to quickly see what would take thousands of years to occur in the natural world with access to key statistics as the program runs, would provide great assistance to students regardless of their ability to grasp topics. I analysed the problem using communication with the client and my own research to propose, design, and develop this solution.
